    <h3>My blog!</h3>
    I've never written or regularly read a blog before in my life, 
    I have no idea what to put here. 
    I didn't give myself enough time to immerse myself in it for the purposes of this assignment.
    <br>

    <h3>My developer journey</h3>
    I was always fascinated in developing ever since I watched the creative liberties Yu-Gi-Oh took when depicting hacking in one episode of the show.
    I cut my teeth on CSI and all their scientific miracles and impossible exploits.
    I spent my teen years obsessing over my favorite TV show: Person of Interest, 
    where software exploits and intrigue built the entire plot.
    My whole life I have spent mystifying computers and how their are used by people.
    I had no idea how to really dig into the nitty gritty and make the mysticism into reality.
    <br>
    <br>
    I pursued a career in medical laboratory science, to try and touch on the lab aspect of my CSI fantasies.
    I endured the pandemic and all the malaise it brought, and could not help but remember something someone had said once.
    A fellow lab member said his cousin had grown weary of being a lawyer, and attended a coding bootcamp.
    More specifically, the Grand Circus bootcamp offered locally here in the Detroit Metropolitan area.
    After the pandemic had wrung me dry, I thought I would finally take the leap.
    <br>
    <br>
    I began Grand Circus's after hours C# bootcamp on July 10th 2023 with several other cohorts joining me on the journey.
    They had me program all sorts of things, from coin flipping, to dice rolling, to rock, paper, scissors.
    I learned about C#, SQL, OOP, CSS, and the HTML I am currently writing with.
    I hope to graduate in mid-January 2024 and get a hybrid position nearby doing something I love.
    <br>

    <h3>My Hometown</h3>
    I was born at the same hospital I currently work at, Royal Oak Beaumont, now called Corewell Health East.
    I was an infant while residing in Berkley, Michigan, before moving to Emerald Lakes until I was about six years old.
    From there, my family moved to Stoney Creek where I attended my K through 12 education, graduating in 2012.
    I went on to Oakland University while living out in Sterling Heights, to attain a Bachelor's of Science in Biological Sciences.
    I purused post-baccalaureate education in an attempt to become a cardiovascular perfusionist but was not accepted to grad school.
    I achieved certification by the American Society of Clinical Pathologist's through my workplace to become a medical technologist.
    I moved to Royal Oak shortly after and became a resident in my former birth city where I spend my days learning to code and working.
