    I was born at the same hospital I currently work at, Royal Oak Beaumont, now called Corewell Health East.
    I was an infant while residing in Berkley, Michigan, before moving to Emerald Lakes until I was about six years old.
    From there, my family moved to Stoney Creek where I attended my K through 12 education, graduating in 2012.
    I went on to Oakland University while living out in Sterling Heights, to attain a Bachelor's of Science in Biological Sciences.
    I purused post-baccalaureate education in an attempt to become a cardiovascular perfusionist but was not accepted to grad school.
    I achieved certification by the American Society of Clinical Pathologist's through my workplace to become a medical technologist.
    I moved to Royal Oak shortly after and became a resident in my former birth city where I spend my days learning to code and working.
